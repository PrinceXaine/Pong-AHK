- My attempt at remaking the classic Pong game in Autohotkey.

# Requirements:
- Right now, the game is in beta and requires Autohotkey v1.1 to use.
- Once the game is completed, I will commit to it here, and release a .exe version as well.

# Current Features:
- You can hit the ball back and forth with the CPU.
- The Mouse stays within the bounds of the window...most of the time.

# Current Bugs
- Trying to fix a glitch in which when the ball gets going fast, it disintegrates (see multi-threading in next section).
- Fixing the perfect, never missing AI.

# Current Update List:
- Scoring System
- Imperfect AI. The AI never misses. Just figuring out the best way to go about fixing this.
- Currently Adding Multi-threading, to increase the overall responsiveness and update speed of GUI.

# Future
- Adding difficulty modes
- Two balls instead of one?
